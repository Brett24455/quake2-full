This Quake 2 mod is an interpretation of the game mode fire fight from the Halo series.
Pressing F1 will bring up the fire fight menu. Rounds begin with soldiers. Pressing O will
cause a soldier to spawn in the first room. As you kill a soldier, more enemies will begin to spawn.
The last enemy of the round is a gladiator. Upon death, the gladiator will drop a pickup, and the
counter for rounds completed will update.
